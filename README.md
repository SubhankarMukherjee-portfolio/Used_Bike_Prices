# Used Bike Prices (By using Power BI)
This Power BI project analyzes used bike market data across major Indian cities to deliver interactive dashboards for consumer, market, and pricing insights. It integrates data segmented by city, bike model, manufacturing year, ownership history, price, mileage, and power (BHP). The dashboards showcase key performance indicators such as total bike sales, average price, mileage, and power, along with the most popular models and top-selling locations. Visualizations include bar charts, line graphs, and dynamic tables for multi-dimensional analysis. The solution enables users to explore temporal, geographic, and ownership-based trends, supporting strategic decisions for buyers, sellers, and market researchers in the used bike industry.

## Objectives of the project
1) To track and visualize used bike sales across major Indian cities using key performance indicators such as total sales, average price, mileage, and power (BHP).
2) To identify top-performing bike models, manufacturing years, and cities contributing most to the used bike market.
3) To analyze price, mileage, and power distribution by model year and ownership history to uncover value and performance trends.
4) To explore the impact of ownership levels (first, second, third, etc.) on bike resale value, mileage, and buyer preference.
5) To provide actionable insights through interactive and filterable Power BI dashboards that enable market analysis, consumer behavior understanding, and strategic business decisions.

## Final Observations & Storyline
The used bike market analysis revealed 1,500 bike models sold across Indian cities, with Delhi leading in both total sales (1,277 units) and number of models (622). The Royal Enfield Classic 350cc (2017) emerged as the most popular model. The average bike price was approximately ₹1.03 lakh, with an average mileage of 44.88 kmpl and average power of 27.29 BHP. Sales peaked for models manufactured between 2010 and 2020, showing a steady rise in both sales and price, with some years exceeding ₹170K in average price. Bikes priced between ₹50K to ₹1.5L showed the highest sales and optimal balance of mileage and power. First-owner bikes accounted for 6,054 sales, outperforming later owners and averaging a higher mileage of 45.22 kmpl. Visual trends also highlighted that as power increased, mileage generally decreased, especially in higher price brackets. A total of over 8 million kilometers were driven by bikes in the mid-price range, emphasizing buyer trust in performance at that tier. The dashboards provided an in-depth view of market trends across time, ownership, and price, enabling strategic insight for buyers, sellers, and dealerships.
